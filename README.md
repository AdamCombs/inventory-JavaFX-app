# Inventory Java Application

## Running the Application
In windows you can navigate to the `dist` folder and open `AdamCombsJavaFXApplication.JAR`

## Objective
This is a simple Java App I created to get familiarized with JavaFX, object oriented programming, and the Model-View-Controller design pattern.

The app has a functionality to create, modify, or delete a new `Part` or `Product`.

It displays the information in an easy to understand interface. 

## Application Structure
This application follows the Model View Controller design pattern. 

+ Model - The model directory contains all of the Java Class files for the Inventory System. These are also located in the `UML Class Diagram.pdf` that I used for the format of this project.

+ View - This holds the `.Fxml` files that are the layout for the user interface.

+ Controller - This holds the Java Class files that controll each view.

+ InventoryJavaFXApplication - The Java file that holds the JavaFX start() method, andcreates a few opening objects for the user to interact with.
